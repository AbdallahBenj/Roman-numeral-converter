# Roman Numeral Converter - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is one of the required steps to earn the certification. In this project, I built a Roman Numeral Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective is to convert integers into Roman numerals following traditional numeral rules, and reinforce algorithmic thinking through logic-based challenges.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Conversion Tool
- **Purpose**: Learn how to transform numerical data using logical structures and conditionals.
- **Skills Learned**: JavaScript logic, conditionals, loops, number handling

## Features
- 🔢 **Integer Input**: Accepts user input as whole numbers within a defined range (typically 1 to 3999).
- 🏛️ **Roman Numeral Output**: Converts the number into accurate Roman numeral format.
- ⚠️ **Validation System**: Handles edge cases such as invalid or out-of-range input.
- 🧠 **Efficient Algorithm**: Uses a logical structure to break down numbers and build Roman numerals efficiently.
- 💬 **Dynamic Feedback**: Displays real-time conversion results in the browser.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Basic layout with input and result display
- **CSS**: Simple and clean styling for a user-friendly interface
- **JavaScript**: Core conversion logic, input handling, and DOM updates

## Installation
